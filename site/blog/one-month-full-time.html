            <p>Christmas day marked one month living full-time in our Airstream. So far, we are loving this lifestyle change. We’ve had our share of challenges, but since officially starting we’ve experienced so much more in a month than we would have in a year of our traditional lifestyle.
</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">New Places</h2>

            <p>In our first month, we hit 5 locations in 4 states. Each time we arrived in a new place, we couldn’t get over that in one Sunday we could pack up, drive, unpack and setup, and be walking around in a completely different state by sundown. We have seen way more landscape changes each week than we’re used to commuting to work every day in North Carolina.
</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">New Faces</h2>

            <p>One thing I’ve been pleasantly surprised about is the social aspect of RVing. I was worried we would be isolated and I would struggle feeling connected with new people as well as friends and family back home. While the latter is still true to a certain extent, being isolated couldn’t be further from the truth! We have met so many people, all of which we immediately have RVing in common with. My fears of not meeting new friends on the road have disappeared. As an extrovert, my “need for people” tank is not in danger of being empty :). Nick as an introvert can recharge in the Airstream, then to socialize he merely has to go for a walk! Honestly, we probably talk to more people in a day now than we did previously.
</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">New experiences</h2>


            <p>We have never spent so much time outside as we have in the past month. We never kayaked or hiked much before, but we’ve been super active doing both lately. We’ve also never been so connected to our water usage, sewage, food waste, etc. We also plan to get scuba certified while we’re in Florida which we’re both pretty pumped about!
</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Marriage relationship growth</h2>

            <p>I could get sappy here, because Nick and I truly love going through life together. But I’ll stop there and spare you haha… We’ve been married for 3 years, and we’ve learned a lot about one another as we’ve tackled all of life’s challenges. One of these current challenges is living and working together in a shared 200 square foot space :) Although we love spending time with one another, being together 24/7 is a lot for any two people, so we’ve gotten purposeful about giving one another space and time to go off on solo adventures at least once a week. Nick may go fishing on his kayak or work from a different location while I may go to a coffee shop, go for a run, or explore whatever town we’re in .
</p>

            <p>When you’re RVing with another person, teamwork is incredibly important. Things like backing the trailer into a spot, dealing with miscellaneous issues that come up (for us the main one was battery issues), and moving days come to mind. On moving days, Nick and I each have our own tasks we’re responsible for which creates a great system that gets us out quickly with everything ready to rock and roll. Knowing the importance of getting everything right before you get on the road can be an automatic attitude adjustment. You can’t afford to be grumpy with your spouse when your home is at stake!
</p>

            <p>To us, being willing to work on yourself and not always point the finger at the other person (as well as being able to laugh at yourself and one another) is the key to a strong relationship. Because we are both adjusting to life on the road, our first month of full-time RVing has reminded us of the need to put the other person above ourselves more than ever!
</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Mindset growth</h2>

            <p>In reflecting on the past month, in my opinion the single most important thing to have when rving full-time is a good mindset. Flexibility, and a positive, can-do attitude can change the tone of your trip. Because sometimes you really don’t know where you will be or what will happen next. You can try to do everything right and plan ahead, but things will still go wrong! If you have the right attitude, you can deal with whatever comes your way without it ruining your day or your trip.
